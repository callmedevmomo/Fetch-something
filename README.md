# Locate Me Ajax

## Challenge:

- Call this URL with AJAX, that URL returns information about your location.

### Conditions:
- [x] Call the URL when the page loads
- [x] Show me an indicator when the request is happening
- [x] When the data comes, show me my location on the HTML


### Notes

Because the URL is not on https, Codesandbox won't let you fetch, so make this example on your computer and then copy paste the code in Codesandbox to submit.

# Reference

- [x] Fetch
